## Significantly Modified Sections

### 1. Introduction Section
**Added language regarding Florida statutes:**

| 2020 Version | 2026 Version |
|--------------|--------------|
| "To the extent that any government ordinance... is less restrictive than these Guidelines... these Architectural Guidelines and the Declaration shall prevail." | "To the extent that Florida statutes limit the Association's authority to regulate certain items or installations, such statutes shall prevail." |

**Impact:** Acknowledges that state law (like solar panel rights, Florida-friendly landscaping) supersedes HOA restrictions.

### 2. Alteration Application Process
**Renamed:** "Alteration Application" → "Alteration Application Process"

**Added clarification:** Applications deemed rejected (not approved) after 30 days.

### 3. Exterior Painting and Approved Color Schemes
**2020 Version:**
> "Only those colors noted on the Approved Paint Colors Exhibit are permitted. Architecture Review Committee seeks to remove the 'Salmon' color scheme and SW0031 Dutch Tile Blue from all approved color schemes."

**2026 Version:**
> "Homeowners changing paint colors must provide an approved paint scheme to the ARC prior to painting. Homeowners repainting with the same colors may either submit for approval their existing paint scheme or photographs of color swatches held against the matching surfaces of their home."

**Impact:** 
- Removed specific color prohibition language
- Added option for homeowners to easily maintain existing colors
- Simplified approval process for repainting same colors

### 4. Fencing Section (Major Reorganization)

**Structural changes:**
- Added clear "Fence Setback Requirements" subsection with consolidated rules

**Content preserved but reorganized:**

**"Like New Condition" Definition:**
- 2020: Lengthy inline definition about cleaning, repairs, 7-day repair period
- 2026: References new Definitions section: "See Definitions section for detailed maintenance standards"

### 5. Flags Section
**2020:** "Flags – Federal, State, Military"
**2026:** Simply "Flags"

**Change:** Removed specific content about flag types from title, but retained Florida Statute 720.304 reference in body.

### 6. Generators
**Added provision:**
> "Generators are normally hard wired to the house's electrical system and run off of propane **or natural gas**."

**Modified screening requirement:**
- 2020: "screened from view from the street with shrubs or other landscaping"
- 2026: "screened from view from the street with shrubs, landscaping, **or fencing**"

### 7. Gutters (Split from Solar)
**2020:** Combined "Gutters and Solar Collectors" section

**Modified grass requirement:**
- 2020: "All Lots shall have grassed front, side **and rear** lawns."

> "No temporary outbuildings, sheds, or other outdoor storage containers shall be permitted on any Lots. Exceptions may be approved by the ARC."

**Impact:** Major policy shift - sheds/storage containers now permitted, just need approval if visible.

### 10. Roofs Section (Consolidated)
**2020:** "Roofs" was a single-line section, with "Front Roof Changes" as a separate section
**2026:** "Front Roof Changes" is now a subsection under "Roofs"

**Added to Roofs:**
> "All shingle replacements must be dimensional with a thirty (30) year life. Any changes to roof/shingle style or color require ARC approval."

### 11. Gas Tanks (Propane and/or Natural)
