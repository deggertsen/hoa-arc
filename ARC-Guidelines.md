## Introduction

This community was developed with the intent that homes harmonize with each other and present a pleasing and consistent style. Except as required by the governing documents, this style is not the result of a formal Architectural code but rather the result of the vision of the original developer.

To ensure the preservation of the existing design and to prevent the introduction of design that is not in keeping with the community theme, the Board of Directors and the Architectural Review Committee (ARC) hereby recognizes and adopts the style and form of the existing community's Architectural standards as required by the governing documents. This standard shall continue in effect until the adoption and publication of new guidelines and standards.

The Architectural Control Committee is responsible for reviewing all Architectural Alteration Applications made by residents for improvements to the exterior of the house or lot. The Board also reviews Architectural Guidelines and recommends changes and/or additions to the Board of Directors for adoption.

To the extent that any government ordinance, building code or regulation requires a more restrictive standard than that found in these Guidelines, the government standards shall prevail. To the extent that any government ordinance, building code or regulation is less restrictive than these Guidelines and any standards contained herein, or the Declaration, these Architectural Guidelines and the Declaration shall prevail.

Nothing contained in these Guidelines shall obligate any agency, governmental or otherwise to approve plans submitted, nor shall the approval of the ARC be construed as meeting either the requirements of Lake County or any governmental agency required for approval.

Capitalized terms which are not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Governing Documents.

Any matters requiring ARC review and approval shall be approved or denied by the ARC in the ARC's sole and absolute discretion as permitted by the Governing Documents.

The ARC has the right to modify, revise, add, delete or make any changes to these guidelines by joint resolution with the Board of Directors.

### Fencing

No fences are approved without the express, prior written approval of the Architectural Review Committee (ARC) of the Reserve at Minneola Homeowners Association, Inc. (HOA). Please note that the ARC has up to 30 days to act on an application. PLEASE PLAN YOUR PROJECT ACCORDINGLY.

#### Fence Setback Requirements

All fences must comply with the following setback requirements:
- **Primary Rule:** No fence shall be constructed closer than ten (10) feet back from the forward facing corners of the house.
- **Exception:** If part of the front face of the house is set deeper (recessed), the minimum setback on that particular side may be reduced to five (5) feet.
- **Front Yard Restriction:** No fence shall be permitted to extend beyond the front corners of the house in any circumstance. Front yards may not be fenced.

#### Standard Lots

a. **Privacy fences** installed for the purpose of enclosing the backyard:
   - Are to be six foot (6') high tongue and groove style white or beige PVC
   - Must comply with setback requirements stated above
   - The fence must be installed immediately inside the property line. Also remember that the fence is on your property and you are responsible to maintain the property up to the property line. This means that you are responsible for trimming the grass on the outside of the fence up to your property line. (Exception – when aluminum picket fence is placed around the perimeter of a swimming pool to meet county code.)

b. **Aluminum picket fence** shall be four foot (4') or five foot (5') high black aluminum open picket style commonly referred to as the Key West style; Maximum five (5) feet in height.

#### Corner Lots

Corner lot fence placement formula: Any side fencing on a typical or regularly shaped corner lot shall be located no more than one-half of the distance between the side wall of the house and the side property line that is next to the side street. The measurement for the distance of this fence shall start at the side wall of the house.

- **ALTERNATE "A"** - Four foot (4') or five foot (5') high black aluminum open picket style 5' off the sidewalk, OR
- **ALTERNATE "B"** - Six foot (6') high white or beige PVC tongue and groove style 5' off the sidewalk.

Fences for corner lots require close coordination with the ARC due to their unique layout and concerns for vehicle visibility/safety and compliance with existing easements and county building code setback requirements. The ARC will also take into consideration how a home abutting this lot will be affected due to front set back requirements for the abutting lot. Fence setbacks on irregularly shaped corner lots will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

#### Storm Water Management Areas (Dry/Wet Ponds)

- **ALTERNATE "A"** - Four foot(4') or five foot(5') high black aluminum fencing on side yard then tapering down to 4' on back of lot is allowed or
- **ALTERNATE "B"** – Six (6') high white or beige PVC privacy fence on side yards - the last eight foot (8) then tapers down as it approaches the rear property line will then transition in height to match the rear fence. The rear fence must be four foot (4') high open picket style either white or beige pvc or black aluminum style fence.

#### Conservation Lots

- **ALTERNATE "A"** - Four foot (4') or five foot (5') high black aluminum fencing on side yard then tapering down to 4' on back of lot is allowed or
- **ALTERNATE "B"** - 6' White or beige PVC privacy fence on side yards - the last eight foot (8) then tapers down as it approaches the rear property line will then transition in height to match the rear fence. The rear fence must be four foot (4') high open picket style either white or beige pvc or black aluminum style fence.

#### General Conditions

a. Front yards may not be fenced

b. All PVC fencing must be white or beige tongue and groove often referred to as the Lexington style. Panels look the same on both sides. Maximum height will be 6'. Fences that abut a perimeter wall or fence must be tapered down to meet the same height of the perimeter wall or fence so as not to exceed its height.

c. Please attach a copy of your plot plan to your alteration application with desired location of fence sketched onto it and denoting setbacks in number of feet. (Please use different color or line style to distinguish survey from alterations)

d. Once approved, the installation must be completed within 90 days.

e. Fencing must remain in "like new" condition at all times. (See Definitions section for detailed maintenance standards)

f. It is recommended that a twelve inch (12") wide mulched maintenance strip be installed and maintained beginning on the property line and continuing under the fence into your yard. This will make it easier to maintain the fence without causing damage and reduces or eliminates the need to trim the grass on the outside of the fence.

g. Fences must have the prior approval of the ARC and must be constructed of materials described above and shall be built to conform to all manufacturers specifications.

h. Fences shall be at a height of six feet with the exception of fences on lots with view corridors such as ponds and conservation areas or other view enhanced areas. The view corridor fence shall be gradually reduced to a height of four (4) feet for the last eight (8) feet of fence that abuts the view corridor.

i. All fences that will abut an existing fence or perimeter wall must be installed with the final end side section graduating in height so that the last panel meets the height of the existing fence or perimeter wall.

j. Fences shall not be installed flush to the ground in order to prevent blockage of storm water drainage.

k. It is recommended that fences not be installed in drainage or utility easements. However, if the ARC grants permission for a fence to be installed in a drainage easement it is the responsibility of the homeowner to correct any changes in drainage on the homeowner's home site or adjoining home sites at the homeowner's expense.

l. Should the Association, City or County be required to correct a drainage or utility situation either above or underground on lots affected by swales, rear yard drains or easements, the homeowner is responsible for all costs associated with the removal and reinstallation of the fence installed in said easement.

m. Only the finished of "smooth" side of the fence may face outward. No posts or stringers may be visible from the outside of the fence.

n. See Fence Setback Requirements section above for detailed setback rules.

o. See Corner Lots section above for corner lot fence placement formula.

p. Only where easements or swales exist, fences will be installed on the property line. Alleyways between fences will not be permitted. (Exception – when aluminum picket fence is placed around the perimeter of a swimming pool to meet county code.)

q. Irrigation systems must be reconfigured to provide complete coverage outside of the fenced area.

r. Any and all required governmental approvals/permits for fence construction are the responsibility of the homeowners and must be obtained prior to construction. It is the responsibility of the Owner to comply with all City, County and/or Association requirements, whichever is most stringent.

The Association reserves the right to prohibit fencing of certain lots due to aesthetic reasons.
